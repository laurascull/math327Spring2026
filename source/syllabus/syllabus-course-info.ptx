    <p>
      If you need to miss class, that is ok. If you miss class, be sure to check Canvas and Webwork for assignments, and try to get notes from a classmate. If you're still having difficulty with the material, use office hours or the Peer Education Center to get caught up. If you need an extension on an assignment, just ask your professor and it will likely be granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need to miss class for an extended period of time, let your professor know so that we may work out a remote accommodation.
