      Stay enrolled in this and your other courses this term by attending class and participating in required course activities during the first week of the term. Instructors have the option to disenroll a student from a class if the student has missed at least one scheduled class in person or via Zoom or required online course activity for online courses (check your syllabus for information) during the first 4 days of the week in which the course is scheduled to meet for the first time. This allows students who are on the course waitlist to be added to the course.

    <title>Course Workload and Time Management</title>
    <p>
      How can you create a weekly schedule based on your courses and study time needed for success? As long as you know the number of credit hours you are taking, it’s easy!  In a face-to-face class, one course credit is the same as one hour of lecture per week for a 15-week term. Additionally, you need to plan for a minimum of two more hours of preparation for each credit hour (and that's according to the federal definition of a credit hour). Thus, in this face-to-face 4-credit course we will meet in person for 4 hours per week, and you should plan on a minimum average of 8 hours per week of homework, reading, and preparation outside of class. Some weeks it may be less; some weeks it may be more. This weekly amount of homework and preparation time will typically vary based on a number of factors about you as a learner and student. Please let me know if you fall behind or need any help figuring out your weekly schedule and meeting these course workload expectations.

    <title>Diversity and Inclusive Classroom Statements </title>
    <p>
      Each member of this class is responsible for contributing to and maintaining an atmosphere of respect for all other members. This means each of us is responsible for ensuring that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          All perspectives and experiences are respected.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Class discussions and individual comments are respectful and do not degrade, stereotype, or promote deficit thinking about any group or individual.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Each person in the class has an opportunity to articulate their perspective and ideas without being demeaned.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Students who demonstrate a disregard for this responsibility will be alerted that their attitudes and/or actions inhibit a respectful and safe learning environment. The instructor reserves the right to take appropriate disciplinary action.

    <title>Email and Netiquitte</title>
    <p>
       “Netiquette” is a protocol for interacting and behaving online.  Although digital interactions are not face-to-face, they affect real people; thus, we must be sensitive to the fact that our words impact others.  The following are an outline of ways that you can communicate professionally and sensitively online:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Be sensitive to others' cultural, social, political and linguistic backgrounds.  Everyone is different and unique.  Remember to show respect for our differences.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Incorporate professionalism and good taste when composing responses in discussion forums, online collaboration and feedback tools, and other interactive spaces.  Avoid profanity and other harsh comments.  Minimize your use of slang, as it can be misinterpreted.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Avoid using all capital letters as it can be construed as “shouting” online, which can be perceived as aggressive behavior.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When using acronyms, make sure to clarify its meaning when you first use in your message.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Proofread your responses for accuracy and tone.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
