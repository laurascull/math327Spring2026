We also acknowledge that this land is connected to the communal and ceremonial spaces of the Jicarilla Abache (Apache), Pueblos of New Mexico, Hopi Sinom (Hopi), and Diné (Navajo) Nations. It is important to acknowledge this setting because the narratives of the lands in this region have long been told from dominant perspectives, without full recognition of the original land stewards who continue to inhabit and connect with this land. Thank you for your attention and respect in acknowledging this important legacy.\"      Course Information    Course Title  Differential Equations   Course Number  MATH 327   Credits  3   Times and Rooms     Section 1 Time and Room(s): 8:00-8:55am, MWF Jones 109   Section 2 Time and Room(s): 12:20-1:15, MWF EBH 034    Instructors    Laura Scull( scull_l@fortlewis.edu )        Course Description  An introduction to ordinary differential equations.

Most assignments will be submitted and graded online in Canvas or Webwork.     Missing Class  Class will begin promptly. Please be in your seat and ready to begin at starting time. Attendance every day is expected. If you must miss class, please contact me and let me know. You are responsible for knowing any and all materials and announcements covered in class.       Learning Outcomes    Course Learning Outcomes     Basic Concepts: students will learn the definition of differential equations and their solutions, and verify solutions to given differential equation or initial value problem.    Solving First Order Differential Equations: students will identify first order versus higher order, linear versus nonlinear, and homogeneous versus non-homogeneous differential equations, apply Existence and Uniqueness Theorem for first order linear initial value problems, and solve first order linear differential equations analytically using integrating factors or separation of variables. Students will sketch and interpret slope fields and phase lines to construct solutions qualitatively. Students will apply this to solving applied problems.    Solving First Order Linear Systems: students will apply matrix theory and Existence and Uniqueness Theorem to first order linear systems, and rewrite higher order scalar equations as first order systems. Students will verify whether or not given vectors are solutions of a given system or initial value problem. Students will use the Wronskian to verify whether or not a solution set is a fundamental set of solutions, and construct general solutions and solve initial value problems. Students will use the eigenvalue method to solve constant coefficient ho- mogeneous systems: Students will use the method of undetermined coefficients to solve non-homogeneous second order linear equations. Students will apply this to model model unforced mechanical vibration, interpreting solutions graphically and categorizing solutions.    Laplace Transforms: Students will compute Laplace transforms using the improper integral definition, use the Heaviside step function in proving and applying the first and second shift theorems, compute Laplace transforms using tables and analytic methods, and solve second order equations using this theory. Students will apply convolutions to the study of the delta function and impulse response. Students demonstrate a conceptual understanding of the meaning of algebraic forms, and recognize differences between algebraic expressions and equations.         Course Requirements and Grading   Final grades will be determined using the following assignment categories (descriptions below):    Assignment Category  Weight    Webwork (Online Homework System)  15%    Weekly Activities  20%    Two Midterm Exams  20% each    Cumulative Final Exam  25%    Grading Scale    Letter Grade Point Range ( )    A    A-    B+    B    B-    C+    C    C-    D+    D    D-    F     Webwork  Webwork is our online homework system. An account has been created for you and a link posted on Canvas. You should check Webwork every class day for new assignments. Their due dates are posted with the assignment. Typically, Webwork assignments will be due at 11:59pm two business days after that section's material has been completed in class. Thus, we have the following:    Day Day Due    Monday Wednesday    Wednesday Friday    Friday Tuesday    After the due date there will be a reduced credit period of 48 hours for each Webwork assignment in which you can receive 75% credit on all work completed.  Because online homework tells you if your answer is right or wrong as soon as you submit it, and for most questions you will be allowed multiple submissions, doing online homework may take you longer than doing written homework. So, give yourself plenty of time by starting your homework ASAP after it is assigned. This will give you time to do the assignment and get help if you need it.    Weekly Activities  Each week, typically on Thursdays, class time will be spent on a modeling activity. Group work will be encouraged, but each student must turn in their own assignment.    Midterm Exams  There will be two midterm exams given in class on Friday, February 13 and Friday, April 3.    Cumulative Final Exam  The final exam will on Monday, Arpil 28 from 12:00-2:00pm. This exam will cover everything we have done in class.      Course Expectations   Save Your Spot  Stay enrolled in this and your other courses this term by attending class and participating in required course activities during the first week of the term. Instructors have the option to disenroll a student from a class if the student has missed at least one scheduled class in person or via Zoom or required online course activity for online courses (check your syllabus for information) during the first 3 days of the week in which the course is scheduled to meet for the first time. This allows students who are on the course waitlist to be added to the course.    Course Workload and Time Management  How can you create a weekly schedule based on your courses and study time needed for success? As long as you know the number of credit hours you are taking, it’s easy! In a face-to-face class, one course credit is the same as one hour of lecture per week for a 15-week term. Additionally, you need to plan for a minimum of two more hours of preparation for each credit hour (and that's according to the federal definition of a credit hour). Thus, in this face-to-face 3-credit course we will meet in person for 3 hours per week, and you should plan on a minimum average of 6-9 hours per week of homework, reading, and preparation outside of class. Some weeks it may be less; some weeks it may be more. This weekly amount of homework and preparation time will typically vary based on a number of factors about you as a learner and student. Please let me know if you fall behind or need any help figuring out your weekly schedule and meeting these course workload expectations.    Diversity and Inclusive Classroom Statements  Each member of this class is responsible for contributing to and maintaining an atmosphere of respect for all other members. This means each of us is responsible for ensuring that:    All perspectives and experiences are respected.    Class discussions and individual comments are respectful and do not degrade, stereotype, or promote deficit thinking about any group or individual.    Each person in the class has an opportunity to articulate their perspective and ideas without being demeaned.    Students who demonstrate a disregard for this responsibility will be alerted that their attitudes and\/or actions inhibit a respectful and safe learning environment. The instructor reserves the right to take appropriate disciplinary action.      Email and Netiquitte  “Netiquette” is a protocol for interacting and behaving online. Although digital interactions are not face-to-face, they affect real people; thus, we must be sensitive to the fact that our words impact others. The following are an outline of ways that you can communicate professionally and sensitively online:    Be sensitive to others' cultural, social, political and linguistic backgrounds. Everyone is different and unique. Remember to show respect for our differences.    Incorporate professionalism and good taste when composing responses in discussion forums, online collaboration and feedback tools, and other interactive spaces. Avoid profanity and other harsh comments. Minimize your use of slang, as it can be misinterpreted.    Avoid using all capital letters as it can be construed as “shouting” online, which can be perceived as aggressive behavior.    When using acronyms, make sure to clarify its meaning when you first use in your message.    Proofread your responses for accuracy and tone.        Campus Policies   Academic Integrity   What is Academic Integrity? Integrity is the College-wide expectation that students follow established guidelines and common knowledge to maintain ethical standards in their work.   Why does it matter? Integrity in academic matters is vital to all members of the College community. An academic integrity violation by a student devalues the accomplishments of other students, threatens the integrity of the College, and undermines the College's educational mission. During their time at FLC, students are expected to know, understand, and comply with the ethical standards of the College.   What is Academic Dishonesty? Academic dishonesty is defined as any form of unethical or illegal behavior regarding any academic work--with or without intent. These standards apply to all courses taken on or off campus, and all modes of course delivery.  Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to, the following:    plagiarism,    cheating,    fabrication and falsification,    multiple submissions\/self-plagiarism,    misuse of academic materials,    unapproved and uncredited use of artificial intelligence,    and complicity in academic dishonesty.    See the full definition of academic dishonesty here: FLCs-Definition-of-Academic-Dishonesty.   If a faculty member alleges that you have committed an academic integrity violation, they will communicate with you and explain the alleged charges and then submit a report of academic dishonesty using this form: Report of Academic Dishonesty.   Faculty may use any legal and ethical method when identifying an academic integrity violation, including the use of plagiarism detection software and artificial intelligence detection software.   What are the consequences? In-class consequences for a charge can range from a reduced grade or zero on the assignment to a reduced grade or “F” in the course. College-wide consequences can range from academic intervention to suspension or expulsion.    Course Policy on use of Generative Artificial Intelligence: Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), such as ChatGPT and other large language models can be extremely helpful as study aids and personalized tutors. You can use them to help explain complex topics or create additional practice problems. However, electronic devices and GAI use is forbidden on all exams and quizzes in this class.     Digital Accessibility  Fort Lewis College commits to ensuring that information technology and digital content it creates or distributes in its programs, services and activities is accessible to all individuals. The Policy on Accessibility of Information Technology and Digital Content reflects Fort Lewis College's commitment to providing access to information technology and digital content to all FLC students, employees and the general public.    Accessibility Resource Center  The Accessibility Resource Center provides inclusive, personalized, caring accommodations for students needing disability-related support. Students are encouraged to reach out to learn more and register for services.  Visit their website or email accessibilityresources@fortlewis.edu or call 970-247-7383.    Course Withdrawal Policy   The last day to withdraw from FLC classes with a grade of “CW” (course withdrawal) is Friday, October 31 at 4pm. This is a college-wide deadline that is not negotiable.  To withdraw from a course using a CW, fill out our online Withdrawal From Course Form at your Student Resource Center . You can also visit Skyhawk Station and pick up a Course Withdrawal form, and our staff will process the CW for you on the spot. This Course Withdrawal will not affect your financial aid for this term, and you will still owe the full amount for the class on your student bill. You should also be aware that dropping a course could affect your Pace Towards Graduation, impacting your eligibility for Financial Aid.      FLC Student Resources   Basic Needs Statement  The Grub Hub cares about your personal and academic success. We recognize that it can be hard to focus in class when you have trouble affording enough food to eat, do not have a safe and reliable place to sleep, and\/or experiencing an emergency or crisis. The Grub Hub offers several services for accessing basic needs. Join us for daily hot meals and a pantry full of free food, hygiene items, menstruation products, and more. We also offer financial assistance for housing insecurity and resource navigation for public benefits that students are eligible for, such as Medicaid and SNAP (a free federal food assistance program that can provide up to $250\/month for groceries). We are located in the Student Union, across from the Post Office, and open Monday-Friday, 10am-5pm. Contact Stella Zhu, the Basic Needs Coordinator (mzhu@fortlewis.edu), if you have questions or need assistance. The Grub Hub is here to support you.    Students as Parents Statement  We are aware that it can be challenging to be a parent while enrolled in college courses and we work to support parents to be successful in this work. If you are unable to attend class due to children's illnesses or unforeseen disruptions in childcare, please contact your instructor individually so we can make an alternate plan to help you meet the course outcomes. We are also happy to speak with you about some strategies that have helped parents in our courses to be successful in balancing home\/school responsibilities.    Reach out for Success  College students encounter setbacks from time to time. If you encounter difficulties and need assistance, it's important to reach out. Consider discussing the situation with an instructor, academic advisor, peer support office, or counselor.
